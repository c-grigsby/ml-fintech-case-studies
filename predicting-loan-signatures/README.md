## Project Overview

Lending companies work by analyzing the financial history of their loan applicants and evaluating whether or not the applicant is too high risk to be given a loan. If the applicant is not, the lender will determine the terms of the loan. To acquire these applicants companies can organically receive them through their websites or apps, often with the assistance of advertisement companies. Other times, lending companies partner with peer-to-peer (P2P) lending marketplaces in order to acquire leads to potential applicants. Examples of P2P lenders include Upstart, Prosper, and LendingClub. In this case study, we will asses the 'quality' of the leads our company receives from these marketplaces.

- **Market**: The target audience is loan applicants who reach out through an intermediary marketplace.

- **Product**: A loan.

- **Goal**: Develop a model to predict 'quality' applicants. In this case study, 'quality' applicants are those who reach a key part of the loan application process.

## Business Challenge

- We will be working for a fintech company that specializes in loans. It offers low APR loans to applicants based on their financial habits, as most lenders do. This company has partnered with a P2P lending marketplace that provides real-time leads (loan applicants). The conversion rates for these leads are satisfactory.

- The company tasks you with creating a model that predicts whether or not these leads will complete the electronic signature phase of the loan application. The company seeks to leverage this model to identify less 'quality' applicants (those not responding to the onboarding process) and experiment with directing them to different onboarding screens.

- The reason for selecting the e-signing process as the response variable is due to the loan application structure:

  - Phase One: The official application begins with the lead arriving on our website after we opted to acquire it. Here the applicant begins the onboarding process to apply for a loan. The user then begins to provide more financial information upon every screen of the onboarding process. Phase One ends with the applicant providing their e-signature indicating that all of the submitted information is accurate.

  - Phase Two: Any of the following screens, in which the applicant is approved or denied and given the terms of the loan is dependent on the company, not the applicant. Therefore the effectiveness of onboarding is measured up to the moment the applicant stops having control of the application process.

## Data

- Because users arrive through a marketplace, we have access to their financial data before the onboarding process begins. This data includes personal information regarding age, income, time employed, debt and other financial metrics. Our company utilizes these financial data points to create risk scores based on a variety of factors.

- We have been provided with a set of scores from algorithms built by the finance and engineering teams. Furthermore, the marketplace itself provides us with their own lead quality scores. Here we will leverage both sets of scores, as well as a small list of personal/financial features to predict if the user is likely to respond to the current onboarding process.

## Model Evaluation Results

- We have developed a model with reasonable discriminatory capabilities to predict whether or not a lead will complete the electronic signature phase of the loan application onboarding process. This model enables the company to target less 'quality' applicants immediately upon acquisition from a P2P lending marketplace and experiment with different onboarding screens and engagement strategies.

- Our optimized model currently provides predictions with scores of approximately 64% Accuracy, 66% Precision, 69% Recall, and 67% F1 on test data. The last recorded AUC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve) was approximately 71%, which is considered reasonable. These are metrics for computer nerds to evaluate models. Our recommendation is to consider this recall score if the existing conversion rates for leads are satisfactory as stated. Recall aims to minimize false negatives (predicting an applicant would not complete the e-signature phase when they actually would) which could be costly and encourage inefficient usage of resources dedicated to converting applicants that were going to sign anyway. Improvements may be achieved by collecting significantly more data, utilizing more advanced ensembling techniques and experimentation with neural networks.

- The model's impact on both the increased number of loans provided to applicants and the resulting boost in revenue can serve as key indicators of its value to the company. ‚ù§Ô∏è ü§ñ
